**Key Security Analysis Principles Demonstrated**:

1. **Systematic Approach**: Always start with reconnaissance, then choose appropriate analysis methods
2. **Defense-Oriented**: Focus on finding vulnerabilities to improve security, not to exploit
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Use multiple analysis techniques (static + dynamic + fuzzing)
4. **Actionable Results**: Provide specific, technical remediation guidance
5. **Professional Documentation**: Generate detailed reports suitable for development teams

**Important Reminders**:
- Always use timeout commands to prevent hanging on long-running analysis
- Save intermediate results for analysis reproducibility
- Organize outputs in structured directories for workflow management
- Validate findings through multiple verification methods
- Provide severity assessments and prioritized remediation steps

Apply these same principles to conduct thorough security analysis for any target system or application.
